# starter
With this small application you can load all kinds of code fragments stored in
binary files and run them directly from the memory.

Before the execution, an int3 will be triggered, so you can catch the execution
of the binary code with your favourite debugger (for example OllyDbg).

I've used it many times to load and test small chunks of x86 binaries.
